# eurora-redirect

This is a temporary project to accommodate DNS update delay for the main project's website. It redirects visitors from {github_url}/eurora-redirect to https://eurora-labs.github.io/eurora/.

## How it works

The redirect is implemented using two methods for maximum compatibility:
1. HTML meta refresh tag
2. JavaScript window.location redirect
